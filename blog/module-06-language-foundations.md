# Module 6 — JavaScript Language Foundations

*Values, types, variables, operators and your first decisions, all in the Console.*

**Time:** about 90 minutes (estimate)

<summary><strong>About this module</strong></summary>

**What this module covers**

You learn values and types, `const` and `let`, operators, comparisons, and `if`/`else`. These are the moves behind every interactive feature: store a value, compare it, decide. They are also where most early bugs come from, so you cause each one on purpose to learn to recognize it.

**Tips for the learner**

Some prompts ask you to explain code to yourself, out loud. Others ask you to write something down. Each habit does a different job.

**Recite to understand.** When a prompt says "out loud," explain the code in your own words, as if you were teaching it. Saying it aloud makes a deeper impression than reading silently. It helps you picture how the pieces of code fit together. And it shows you right away which line you cannot explain yet. That line is the one to review.

**Write it down to check yourself.** When a prompt says "write down," it is usually a prediction, a choice, or a guess about a bug. A written answer can't change after you see the result, so the comparison is fair and you learn from the difference. Writing also keeps your attention on the lesson and helps you pick out the main points.

**Keep one notebook for this course.** Use it for your predictions, key terms, steps, mistakes, and questions to come back to. Date each entry and write the module number, so you can find it later. Before you start a new module, read your last few entries and recite one or two of them out loud.

**The four badges**

Every core concept moves through the same four steps, called IEIA. Each step is marked with its badge.

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Introduce** (a lightbulb: a new idea) - You meet the concept: its name, and why it matters to you, in a sentence or two.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Explain** (a speech bubble: the idea in words) - How it works, one idea at a time, in plain words.

<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Illustrate** (an eye: see it) - A small example you can look at: a code snippet, a real screenshot or a diagram. Its caption, which starts with this badge, tells you what to notice.

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Apply** (a keyboard: your turn) - A short task to do right now, before you read on. Often you type or predict something; sometimes you write it down, sketch it, or explain code to yourself out loud.

**In this module you will learn:**

- What a value is, and the five basic types in this module: string, number, boolean, undefined and null
- How `typeof` tells you a value's type, including the odd result for `null`
- How to store values with `const` and `let`, and why this course does not use `var`
- The difference between assignment (`=`) and comparison (`===`)
- The arithmetic operators, and why `+` behaves differently with text
- The comparison operators, and why `===` is safer than `==`
- That every comparison produces a Boolean: `true` or `false`
- How `if`, `else if` and `else` choose which code runs

## Why this matters

Every interactive thing on a web page comes down to a few small moves. Store a value. Compare it with something. Decide what to do. A dark-mode switch, a form check, a gallery's Next button: all of them do exactly that. This module teaches those moves on their own, in the Console and in Node, with no page to distract you.

Most early JavaScript bugs come from the topics in this module. Text that looks like a number but is not one. A single `=` where you meant to compare. A `==` that says two different things are equal. You will cause each of these on purpose, so you recognize them later when you did not mean to.

As in Module 5, nothing touches your site yet. Every result in this post was produced by running the code, and you will run the same code yourself.

## Before you start

1. Finish Module 5. You should be able to run `node hello.js` in your `practice-05` folder and open the Console with Ctrl+Shift+J.
2. In your course folder, create a new folder called `practice-06`, next to `practice-05`. Open `practice-06` in VS Code with **File → Open Folder…** and open a terminal in it.
3. Open Edge or Chrome. Press **F12** (or **Ctrl+Shift+J**) to open DevTools, then click the **Console** tab. Keep it beside VS Code; you will switch between them.

> **Checkpoint.** You have a terminal whose prompt ends in `practice-06>` and a browser Console with a blinking cursor next to `>`.

## Core concepts

### 1. What are values and types?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> A **value** is one piece of data: a word, a number, yes or no. Every value has a **type**, and the type decides what you can do with it.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Five types cover almost everything in this course. (JavaScript has three more: objects, which you will meet in Module 8, and BigInt and Symbol, which this course does not use.) A **string** is text, always inside quotes: `"hello"`, `"42"`. A **number** is a number with no quotes: `42`, `3.5`. A **boolean** is `true` or `false`. **undefined** means a variable has no value yet. **null** means "nothing here," on purpose; you assign it yourself. The `typeof` operator tells you the type, as a string. One result looks wrong: `typeof null` gives `"object"`. MDN's *typeof* page explains it as a leftover from the first version of JavaScript; a fix was proposed for the language, but it was rejected. Remember it as a known exception.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![The Console showing typeof for "hello", 42, 3.5, true, undefined, null and "42", with results string, number, number, boolean, undefined, object, string.](images/m06-typeof.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Look at the last line: `"42"` is a string, not a number, because of the quotes. And `typeof null` really is `"object"`. As in Module 5, your Console may show text in single quotes, such as `'string'`; both mean text. (real output, rendered; evaluated in Chromium)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> In the Console, type `typeof "true"`. Predict first: quotes or no quotes?

### 2. How do you store a value: const or let?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> A **variable** is a name that holds a value. You create one with `const` or `let`.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Use `const` when the name should always hold the same value, and `let` when it needs to change. MDN's *const* page says a constant's value "can't be changed through reassignment." Start with `const` every time; switch to `let` only when you find you need to change it. A `let` with no value holds `undefined` until you give it one. You will also see `var` in older code and tutorials. It follows older rules about where a name can be used (an idea called *scope*, which Module 7 explains), and those rules cause surprises. This course uses only `const` and `let`.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![The Console: let visits = 1, visits = visits + 1 gives 2, const siteName = "My Site", siteName gives "My Site", let note, note gives undefined.](images/m06-const-let.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Declaring a variable shows `undefined`: the Console reports that the declaration itself has no value, just as with `console.log()` in Module 5. `visits = visits + 1` reads the right side first (1 + 1), then stores 2. (real output, rendered; evaluated in Chromium)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> **What value does this variable hold?** After `let count = 5;` and `count = count + 10;`, what is in `count`? Type it to check.

### 3. What is the difference between = and ===?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> One `=` **assigns**: it puts a value into a variable. Three `===` **compare**: they ask whether two values are the same.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Read `mood = "busy"` as "mood becomes busy." Read `mood === "busy"` as "is mood busy?" The first changes the variable. The second only asks a question and answers `true` or `false`. Mixing them up is one of the most common beginner mistakes, because in math class `=` meant "is equal to."

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![The Console: let mood = "calm", mood === "busy" gives false, mood = "busy" gives "busy", mood === "busy" gives true.](images/m06-assign-compare.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *The comparison does not change `mood`. Only the assignment on the third line does. (real output, rendered; evaluated in Chromium)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Explain each line of the image to yourself, out loud, using "becomes" for `=` and "is it…?" for `===`.[^recite]

### 4. How does arithmetic work, and why is + different?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> JavaScript has the arithmetic you know: `+`, `-`, `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), plus `%`, which gives the **remainder** after dividing.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `+` has two jobs. With two numbers it adds. If either side is a string, it **joins** them into one longer string, so `"5" + 3` is `"53"`. The other operators only do math, so JavaScript turns the text `"5"` into the number 5: `"5" - 3` is `2`. JavaScript also works from left to right. In `"Total: " + 2 + 3`, it first joins `"Total: "` and `2`, then joins `3`. Parentheses force the math to happen first.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![The Console: 7 + 2 is 9, 7 - 2 is 5, 7 * 2 is 14, 7 / 2 is 3.5, 7 % 2 is 1, "5" + 3 is "53", "5" - 3 is 2, "5" * 2 is 10, "Total: " + 2 + 3 is "Total: 23", "Total: " + (2 + 3) is "Total: 5".](images/m06-arithmetic.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Watch the quotes on the results: `"53"` and `"Total: 23"` are strings; `2` and `10` are numbers. (real output, rendered; evaluated in Chromium)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Predict `10 % 3` and `"10" + 1`. Then type both.

### 5. How do comparisons work, and why === instead of ==?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Comparison operators ask a question about two values: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `===` (same), `!==` (not the same).

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> There are two kinds of "equal." `===` is **strict**: MDN's *Strict equality* page says it "always considers operands of different types to be different." `==` is **loose**: if the types differ, it "attempts to convert them to the same type before comparing." That is why `5 == "5"` is `true` and `0 == false` is `true`. Loose equality hides type mistakes, so this course always uses `===` and `!==`.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![The Console: 10 > 9 true, 10 >= 10 true, 3 !== 4 true, 5 === 5 true, 5 === "5" false, 5 == "5" true, 0 == false true, 0 === false false, null == undefined true, null === undefined false.](images/m06-equality.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Every pair of `==` and `===` lines gives opposite answers. Strict equality is the one that agrees with what you can see. (real output, rendered; evaluated in Chromium)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Predict `"7" === 7` and `"7" == 7` before you type them.

### 6. What does a comparison produce?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Every comparison produces a **Boolean**: `true` or `false`.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> A Boolean is a value like any other. You can store it in a variable, log it, and check its type. Naming such a variable as a yes-or-no question, like `needsJacket` or `isOpen`, makes code easier to read. This matters for the next concept: `if` runs its code when the value inside its parentheses is `true`.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![The Console: const temp = 62, temp < 50 gives false, const needsJacket = temp < 70, needsJacket gives true, typeof needsJacket gives "boolean".](images/m06-boolean-results.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *The comparison `temp < 70` was worked out once and its answer, `true`, was stored. (real output, rendered; evaluated in Chromium)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Write a line that stores whether a number is greater than 100, with a question-style name. Check its `typeof`.

### 7. How does a program make a decision?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `if` runs a block of code only when a condition is `true`. `else if` adds another condition to check. `else` catches everything left over.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> JavaScript checks the conditions **from top to bottom** and runs the block for the **first one that is true**. Then it skips the rest and carries on after the last `}`. At most one block runs. Order matters: in the script below, `temp < 70` can only be reached when `temp < 50` was false, so the second block means "50 to 69." The code inside each block is indented two spaces so you can see what belongs to it. VS Code uses four spaces by default (its *Basic editing* page: "4 spaces per Tab key"); that is fine too, because the spaces do not change what the code does. **Careful:** never put a semicolon right after `if (...)`, or between a block's closing `}` and `else`, even though Module 5 ends every statement with one. In `if (temp < 50); { … }`, the semicolon ends the `if`, so the block runs every time. If no `else` follows, you get no error message at all; if an `else` follows, Node stops with `SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'else'`.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;">

```js
// weather.js: suggest what to wear from the temperature (degrees F)
const temp = 40;

if (temp < 50) {
  console.log("Wear a coat");
} else if (temp < 70) {
  console.log("Bring a jacket");
} else {
  console.log("T-shirt weather");
}

console.log("Checked " + temp + " degrees");
```

![A decision diagram: temp < 50? true leads to Wear a coat; false leads to temp < 70? true leads to Bring a jacket; false leads to else: T-shirt weather.](images/m06-if-flow.png)
*Checked top to bottom; the first true condition wins.*

![A terminal running node weather.js three times, printing Wear a coat and Checked 40 degrees, Bring a jacket and Checked 62 degrees, T-shirt weather and Checked 85 degrees.](images/m06-if-else-node.png)
*The file was edited and saved between runs, with `temp` set to 40, then 62, then 85. Each run printed exactly one suggestion, and the last line ran every time because it is outside the `if`. On Windows the output is the same. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux, with the folder path changed to the course folder)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Create `weather.js` in `practice-06` and type the script above. Save, then run `node weather.js` in the terminal. It should print `Wear a coat` and `Checked 40 degrees`, like the first run in the image. **What happens if this changes?** Predict the output for `temp` set to `50` and to `70`, and write your predictions down. Change the number on line 2, save and run again for each one. Those are the edges, and edges are where bugs live. (Check: `50` prints `Bring a jacket`, because `50 < 50` is false. `70` prints `T-shirt weather`, because `70 < 70` is also false.)

## Exercise

*Your hands, about 40 minutes (estimate).* Type it, do not paste it. Work in the Console unless a step says otherwise.

1. **Predict on paper.** Copy the **Type this** column of this table and write your prediction next to each line. Do not run anything yet.

   | # | Type this | Your prediction |
   |---|---|---|
   | a | `typeof "7"` | |
   | b | `typeof 7` | |
   | c | `"7" + 7` | |
   | d | `"7" - 7` | |
   | e | `7 + 7 + "7"` | |
   | f | `"7" + 7 + 7` | |
   | g | `10 / 4` | |
   | h | `10 % 4` | |
   | i | `7 == "7"` | |
   | j | `7 === "7"` | |
   | k | `typeof (7 > 3)` | |
   | l | `typeof undefined` | |
   | m | `typeof null` | |

2. **Run.** Type each line into the Console. Mark each prediction right or wrong. Then check against the results we got in Chromium:

   | # | Result | | # | Result |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | a | `"string"` | | h | `2` |
   | b | `"number"` | | i | `true` |
   | c | `"77"` | | j | `false` |
   | d | `0` | | k | `"boolean"` |
   | e | `"147"` | | l | `"undefined"` |
   | f | `"777"` | | m | `"object"` |
   | g | `2.5` | | | |

   For every one you got wrong, write one sentence on why. Lines e and f are worth the most time: they use the same three values in a different order.
3. **Modify.** Change line c to use `*` instead of `+`. Predict, then run.
4. **Create.** Write two variables of your own with `const`, one a number and one a string that looks like a number. Write one comparison between them that is `true` with `==` and `false` with `===`.
5. **Break it on purpose.** In the Console type `const city = "Fresno"` (or any city), press Enter, then type `city = "Chicago"` and press Enter. Read the error. Then type `city` to see what it holds now.

   ![The Console: const city = "Fresno", then city = "Chicago" gives Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable. at anonymous 1:6, then city still gives "Fresno".](images/m06-const-error.png)
   *Name: `TypeError`. Message: `Assignment to constant variable.` The value did not change. MDN's *const* page notes the exact wording can differ between browsers; this is Chromium's, the engine inside Edge and Chrome. (real output, rendered; evaluated in Chromium)*

   One Console difference: the Console lets you type a whole `const` line again to start over, so `const city = "Chicago"` would work there. In a file, declaring the same name twice is an error: Node stops with `SyntaxError: Identifier 'city' has already been declared`.

6. **Same mistake in Node.** Create `break-const.js` in `practice-06` with these three lines, save, and run `node break-const.js`:

   ```js
   const city = "Fresno";
   city = "Chicago";
   console.log(city);
   ```

   ![A terminal showing node break-const.js with the error pointing at line 2, a caret under the equals sign, and TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.](images/m06-const-error-node.png)
   *Same name and message as the Console, plus the file and line from Module 5's error-reading routine. Line 3 never ran. Your own error shows the path to your own file. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux, with the folder path changed to the course folder)*

   Fix it by changing `const` to `let` on line 1. Run again and confirm it prints `Chicago`. Then ask yourself whether `let` was the right fix, or whether the program should never have changed the city.

## Project (in the full packet)

The Project is a **"plan my day"** script. You set one number, the hour of the day from 0 to 23, and the script decides what to print: a different plan for the morning, the afternoon and the evening, plus a polite message when the hour makes no sense, like 25. You will choose your own time ranges, predict the output for the edge hours before you run them, and test every branch on purpose. The full brief, the step-by-step build, and the finishing work in Git are in the Module 6 packet. [Get the packet →](PACKET_LINK_MODULE_6)

## Common misconception

> *"`=` means equals, like in math."*

What would you say? Hint: look at `visits = visits + 1` in Core Concept 2. In math that line could never be true.

## Summary

A value is one piece of data with a type, and this module's five types are string, number, boolean, undefined and null; `typeof` names the type, and `typeof null` is `"object"` for historical reasons. `const` holds a value that will not be reassigned, `let` holds one that will, and this course does not use `var`. One `=` assigns; `===` compares. `+` adds numbers but joins strings, while `-`, `*`, `/` and `%` only do math. `===` treats different types as different; `==` converts them first, which hides mistakes. Every comparison produces a Boolean you can store and test. `if`, `else if` and `else` check conditions from top to bottom and run only the first block whose condition is true.

## Check your understanding

1. Why is `"5" + 3` equal to `"53"`, but `"5" - 3` equal to `2`?
2. A teammate writes `if (answer == 0)`. What would you change, and why?
3. **What value does this variable hold?** After these lines, what is in `total`, and what is its type?

   ```js
   let total = "10";
   total = total + 5;
   ```

## Before next module

- [ ] You can name this module's five basic types and check any value with `typeof`
- [ ] You start every variable with `const` and switch to `let` only when it must change
- [ ] You can explain `"5" + 3` and `"5" - 3` without running them
- [ ] You use `===` and `!==`, never `==`
- [ ] `weather.js` runs, and you tested the edge values 50 and 70
- [ ] You caused the const `TypeError` in the Console and in Node and can read both
- [ ] If you did this module's packet project in my-site, saved it with the routine: git status → git add . → git commit -m "…" → git push → check the live page. (Your practice folder is not saved to GitHub.)

## Go further

- MDN: *typeof* (including the section on `typeof null`)
- MDN: *const*, *let* and *var*
- MDN: *Strict equality (===)* and *Equality (==)*
- MDN: *if...else*
- MDN: *JavaScript error reference* (for *TypeError*)
- freeCodeCamp: the free [JavaScript Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-v9/) (checked 2026-10-11) has practice on this topic.

## What to keep

Keep your filled-in prediction table, with a sentence beside every line you got wrong, and keep `weather.js` in `practice-06`. Then answer for yourself: **which step would be hardest to repeat without this post, and why?**

[^recite]: **Why out loud?** Most people have recited something to learn it by heart: a phone number, a poem, lines for a play. Words you say aloud stick better than words you read silently; memory researchers call this the production effect (Ozubko and MacLeod, 2010). Explaining code to yourself out loud uses the same idea. It also shows you the line you cannot explain yet, and that line is the one to study next.
