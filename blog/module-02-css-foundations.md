# Module 2 — CSS Foundations

*Give your pages color, type and spacing, and learn exactly which rule wins.*

**Time:** about 2.5 hours (estimate)

<summary><strong>About this module</strong></summary>

**What this module covers**

You learn to link a stylesheet, write rules for color, type and spacing, predict which rule wins, and build a navigation bar with Flexbox. It saves you hours: when a rule "does nothing," the cause is almost always one of the three problems this module teaches on purpose.

**Tips for the learner**

Some prompts ask you to explain code to yourself, out loud. Others ask you to write something down. Each habit does a different job.

**Recite to understand.** When a prompt says "out loud," explain the code in your own words, as if you were teaching it. Saying it aloud makes a deeper impression than reading silently. It helps you picture how the pieces of code fit together. And it shows you right away which line you cannot explain yet. That line is the one to review.

**Write it down to check yourself.** When a prompt says "write down," it is usually a prediction, a choice, or a guess about a bug. A written answer can't change after you see the result, so the comparison is fair and you learn from the difference. Writing also keeps your attention on the lesson and helps you pick out the main points.

**Keep one notebook for this course.** Use it for your predictions, key terms, steps, mistakes, and questions to come back to. Date each entry and write the module number, so you can find it later. Before you start a new module, read your last few entries and recite one or two of them out loud.

**The four badges**

Every core concept moves through the same four steps, called IEIA. Each step is marked with its badge.

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Introduce** (a lightbulb: a new idea) - You meet the concept: its name, and why it matters to you, in a sentence or two.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Explain** (a speech bubble: the idea in words) - How it works, one idea at a time, in plain words.

<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Illustrate** (an eye: see it) - A small example you can look at: a code snippet, a real screenshot or a diagram. Its caption, which starts with this badge, tells you what to notice.

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Apply** (a keyboard: your turn) - A short task to do right now, before you read on. Often you type or predict something; sometimes you write it down, sketch it, or explain code to yourself out loud.

**In this module you will learn:**

- How to link an external stylesheet with `<link rel="stylesheet">`
- The parts of a CSS rule: selector, property, value, declaration
- Colors, typography and spacing: `color`, `background-color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `line-height`, `margin`, `padding`
- Element selectors vs class selectors, writing reusable rules, and the descendant selector (`nav a`)
- The cascade and specificity: which rule wins when two rules disagree
- Block boxes vs inline boxes in normal flow
- Flexbox for a navigation bar: `display: flex`, `gap`, `justify-content`, `align-items`
- Saving packet-project work in `my-site` with the Git routine from Module 1

## Why this matters

In Module 1 you wrote structure. Every page looked the same: black serif text on white. CSS is the layer that decides how things look. It is also the layer where beginners lose the most time, because a rule they wrote "does nothing" and they cannot see why.

Almost every time, the reason is one of three things: the stylesheet is not linked, another rule is winning, or the element is a different kind of box than they thought. This module teaches all three on purpose, with pages rendered in a real browser so you can see each rule win or lose.

By the end you will style a page with one shared stylesheet and build a navigation bar with Flexbox.

## Before you start

1. Finish Module 1. Your `my-site` folder should be live on GitHub Pages, with your first page (or with your Home and About pages, if you did the Module 1 packet project).
2. Make a throwaway folder next to `my-site` called `practice-02`. Copy your `practice-01/index.html` and your image into it.
3. Open `practice-02` in VS Code (**File → Open Folder…**). Open `index.html` in Edge or Chrome (double-click it in File Explorer, or drag it onto a browser window). After each save, press **F5** to reload. Press **F12** (or **Ctrl+Shift+J**) to open DevTools, then click the **Console** tab.

> **Checkpoint.** You can edit `practice-02/index.html`, save, refresh, and see the change. Your live site from Module 1 still opens.

## Core concepts

### 1. How does a page get its styles?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> CSS lives in its own file, usually called `styles.css`, next to your HTML. A `<link>` element in the `<head>` tells the browser to fetch it.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` has two parts. `rel="stylesheet"` says what kind of file it is. `href` is a relative path, exactly like the links you wrote in Module 1. The browser requests that file as a second request after the HTML. One stylesheet can be linked from every page of a site, so one change restyles all of them.

```html
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
  <title>Home | Practice Site</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![Two renders of the same page side by side. Left, without the link line: black serif text on white with blue underlined links. Right, with the link: a dark blue header with white text and links, a light background and sans-serif text.](images/m02-before-after-link.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *The HTML is identical except for one `<link>` line. Each side was rendered at 560 px wide; the labels above them were added to the picture. (real: rendered in Chromium)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Think this through: which part of the `<link>` element would you check first if a page showed no styles at all? (The `href`.)

### 2. What are the parts of a CSS rule?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> A stylesheet is a list of **rules**. Each rule picks some elements and says how they should look.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> The **selector** comes first and chooses the elements. Inside the curly braces are **declarations**. Each declaration is a **property**, a colon, a **value** and a semicolon. A missing colon breaks that one declaration. A missing semicolon breaks that declaration *and the next one*, because the browser reads the two as one long value that makes no sense. (The semicolon after the last declaration, just before `}`, is optional, so leaving out that one breaks nothing.) The browser shows no error, so look closely when a line "does nothing," and check the line above it too.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A rule h1 { color: #d1495b; font-size: 36px; } with labels: selector points to h1, property to font-size, value to 36px, and declaration to the property: value; pair.](images/m02-rule-anatomy.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Selector, then declarations in braces. Colon between property and value, semicolon after.*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Write a rule on paper that makes every `<h2>` green. Check it has a selector, braces, a colon and a semicolon.

### 3. Which properties give you color, type and spacing?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> A handful of properties do most of the work on a simple page.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `color` sets text color; `background-color` sets the color behind it. Colors can be names (`white`) or hex codes (`#2b2d42`). `font-family` lists fonts in order of preference, ending with a generic family such as `serif` or `sans-serif` as a fallback. `font-size` sets text size, and `line-height` sets the space between lines (a plain number like `1.5` means 1.5 times the font size). `padding` is space *inside* an element's edge; `margin` is space *outside* it. You will study the box model properly in Module 3. Some properties are **inherited**: MDN notes that `color` is, so setting it on `body` colors the text inside it, while `margin`, `padding` and `border` are not.

```css
body {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  color: #2b2d42;
  background-color: #fdf6ec;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0 16px 24px;
}
```

<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> The Exercise page later in this post uses exactly these properties.

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Predict: if you set `color: purple` on `body`, what color will a paragraph be? (Purple, by inheritance, unless another rule sets the paragraph's color.)

### 4. What is the difference between an element selector and a class selector?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> An **element selector** is a tag name, such as `p` or `h2`. A **class selector** starts with a dot, such as `.highlight`, and matches any element with `class="highlight"`.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Element selectors style every element of that kind, which is right for site-wide basics. Class selectors style only the elements you mark, which makes them **reusable**: write the rule once, then add the class to any element that needs it, on any page. Choose class names for what something *is* (`.highlight`, `.note`), not what it looks like today (`.orange`), so the name still makes sense after a redesign.

```css
p { color: gray; }           /* every paragraph */
.highlight {                 /* only elements with class="highlight" */
  background-color: #edae49;
  padding: 8px 12px;
}
```

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> You can also join two selectors with a space. `nav a` is a **descendant selector**: it matches every `a` that sits anywhere inside a `nav`, and no other links. (MDN calls the space a *descendant combinator*.) You will use it in the Exercise to make only the nav links white.

```css
nav a { color: white; }      /* links inside the nav; other links keep their color */
```

<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> In the Exercise screenshot, only the paragraph with `class="highlight"` gets the orange background.

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Name one element on your Home page that should use an element selector and one that should use a class.

### 5. When two rules disagree, which one wins?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Often more than one rule matches the same element and sets the same property. The **cascade** is the browser's method for choosing one.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> For the rules you write, two tests decide. First, **specificity**: MDN (*Handling conflicts*) describes an id selector as more specific than a class selector, and a class selector as more specific than an element selector. Compare the columns left to right: MDN says "a *million* **class** selectors combined would not be able to overwrite the specificity of *one* **id** selector." Second, only if specificity ties, **source order**: "the one that is defined last in the stylesheet is the one that will be used." So a later rule does not automatically win. It wins only against a rule of equal specificity.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A table scoring selectors in three columns, ID, Class and Element: p is 0-0-1, .note is 0-1-0, #special is 1-0-0, and .tag twice is 0-1-0, a tie where the later rule wins.](images/m02-specificity.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Read the columns from left to right; the first column that differs decides.*

Here is a real test. To keep it apart from the Exercise, make two new files in `practice-02`: `cascade.html`, whose `<head>` links `cascade.css`, and `cascade.css` itself. The page's `<body>` holds four paragraphs. Each has an `id` so the Console picture below can find it; only `#special` has a rule.

```html
<p id="one">1. Only the element rule (p) matches me.</p>
<p id="two" class="note">2. The element rule and the class rule (.note) both match me.</p>
<p id="special" class="note">3. Element, class and id (#special) rules all match me.</p>
<p id="four" class="tag">4. Two .tag rules match me. They tie, so the later one wins.</p>
```

The stylesheet sets `p` to gray, then `#special` to purple, then `.note` to green, then `.tag` to blue, and finally `.tag` to crimson. Notice that `#special` comes *before* `.note` in the file.

```css
p        { color: gray; font-size: 20px; }
#special { color: purple; }
.note    { color: green; }
.tag     { color: blue; }
.tag     { color: crimson; }
```

![Four lines of text. Line 1 (only p matches) is gray. Line 2 (p and .note) is green. Line 3 (p, .note and #special) is purple. Line 4 (two .tag rules) is crimson.](images/m02-cascade-winners.png)
*Line 3 is purple even though the `.note` rule comes later: the id is more specific. Line 4 is crimson because the two `.tag` rules tie and the later one wins. (real: rendered in Chromium)*

![A DevTools-style Console asking the browser for the computed color of each line: rgb(128, 128, 128), rgb(0, 128, 0), rgb(128, 0, 128) and rgb(220, 20, 60).](images/m02-cascade-console.png)
*The same page, asking the browser which color it actually used for each line: gray, green, purple, crimson. You do not need to type this yet; the Console is taught in the JavaScript modules. (real output, rendered)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Predict: if you move the `#special` rule to the very end of the file, does line 3 change color? (No. It already had the highest specificity; order only breaks ties.)

### 6. What is the difference between block and inline boxes?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Every element is drawn as a box. In normal flow, most boxes are either **block** or **inline**.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Block boxes, such as `h1`–`h6`, `p`, `ul`, `section` and `nav`, start on a new line and, by default, stretch across the full width of their container. MDN (*Block and inline layout in normal flow*) says block elements in English "lay out vertically, one below the other," and even with a width set "they will continue to lay out one below the other." Inline boxes, such as `a`, `span`, `em` and `strong`, sit in the line of text like words. MDN (*The box model*) says that for an inline box, "The `width`, `height`, and top and bottom margins will have no effect." When a `width` rule seems to do nothing, check whether the element is inline.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![Block boxes outlined in solid blue stretch across the page and stack. Inline boxes outlined in dashed orange (a link, strong text and a span) sit inside a line of text; the span with width: 300px is no wider than its text. A paragraph with width: 300px is narrow but the next paragraph still starts below it.](images/m02-block-inline.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Blue = block, orange dashes = inline. The `span` has `width: 300px` and ignores it. The narrow paragraph obeys it, and the next block still starts on a new line. Measured at 800 px wide. (real: rendered in Chromium)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Add `outline: 2px solid red;` to a rule for `a` on any page and look at the shape of the boxes. Outlines are a quick way to see boxes without changing the layout.

### 7. How does Flexbox lay out a navigation bar?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Your nav links sit in a line because they are inline. To control spacing and alignment you turn their container into a **flex container** with `display: flex`.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `display: flex` goes on the *parent* (the `nav`). Its children become **flex items** and line up in a row. `gap` puts a fixed space between items. `justify-content` places items along the row: the default packs them at the start of the row; other values include `flex-end`, `center` or `space-between`, which pushes the first and last items to the edges and spreads the rest. `align-items` lines items up across the row; its default stretches them to the tallest item, and `center` centers them. One thing changes when you switch: the spaces from the line breaks between your `<a>` tags no longer show, so you use `gap` instead.

```css
nav {
  display: flex;
  gap: 16px;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

The bars in the picture below hold a big **My Site** label and three links. In the picture the links also have a background color and padding, so you can see their boxes. To try it yourself, use this HTML with the `nav` rule above and add `.logo { font-size: 40px; }` (`href="#"` just goes to the top of the page):

```html
<nav>
  <span class="logo">My Site</span>
  <a href="#">Home</a>
  <a href="#">About</a>
  <a href="#">Contact</a>
</nav>
```

The big label is what makes `align-items` visible. When every item is the same height, like the two links in the Exercise nav, `align-items: center` changes nothing you can see.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![Five versions of the same navigation bar with a large My Site label and three links. 1: no flexbox, links sit in a line with small spaces. 2: display flex, links touch. 3: gap 16px, links spaced. 4: justify-content space-between, items spread across the bar with links stretched tall. 5: align-items center, links centered vertically.](images/m02-flex-nav.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Each bar adds one declaration. Compare 2 and 3 for `gap`, 3 and 4 for `justify-content`, and 4 and 5 for `align-items`: in 4 the links stretch to the height of the big label; in 5 they are centered. Measured at 800 px wide. (real: rendered in Chromium)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Predict what `justify-content: center` would do to bar 3. Then try it in the Exercise.

## Exercise

*Your hands, about 45 minutes (estimate).* Work in `practice-02`. Type every line. Do not paste.

1. Create a new file in `practice-02` called `styles.css`.
2. In `index.html`, add `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` as the last line inside `<head>`.
3. Add a `<nav>` at the top of `<body>` with two same-page links to two of your `<h2>` headings (give each heading an `id`, as in Module 1). Add `class="highlight"` to one paragraph.
4. **Predict.** Before you write any CSS, think this through: what will change when you add a `body` rule with a background color?
5. In `styles.css`, type a `body` rule (font, color, background, margin, padding), an `h1` rule and an `h2` rule with different colors, a `.highlight` rule, a `nav` rule with `display: flex`, `gap`, `padding` and a background color, and a `nav a` rule that makes the links white. Use your own colors.
6. **Run.** Save both files and press **F5** in the browser.

   ![The practice page at phone width: a dark nav bar with two white links, a red main heading, an orange highlighted paragraph, teal section headings, a bulleted list, a paragraph with a blue link and a picture, on a cream background.](images/m02-exercise-phone.png)
   *One example, measured at 390 px wide, about the width of a phone. Your colors and words will differ. (page real: rendered in Chromium; browser frame drawn)*

7. **Modify.** Add `justify-content: center;` to the `nav` rule. Save, refresh, and check your prediction from Concept 7. Then add a second `.highlight` rule *below* the first with a different background color. Which one wins, and why?
8. **Break it on purpose.** In `index.html`, change `href="styles.css"` to `href="style.css"` (one letter missing). Save and refresh.

   ![The same practice page with no styles at all: black serif text, blue underlined links side by side, no colors or background.](images/m02-break-href.png)
   *Every style is gone, but nothing on the page says why. The HTML still works; only the request for the stylesheet failed. (page real: rendered in Chromium; browser frame drawn)*

   Press **F12** (or **Ctrl+Shift+J**) to open DevTools, then click the **Console** tab.

   ![A DevTools-style Console showing one red error: Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND.](images/m02-break-console.png)
   *The browser did report the problem, just not on the page. In real DevTools the line also names the file it could not find. (real output, rendered; captured from Chromium loading the broken page from disk)*

   Edge and Chrome may lay out this message a little differently. Look for the red error and the file name it could not load. If the page came from a server instead of from disk (for example through Live Preview), the same mistake shows `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)` instead: the server answered that it has no such file.

9. **Debug.** Fix the `href`, save and refresh. Then make a second, different mistake: delete the colon in one declaration, such as `color #d1495b;`. Which part of the page lost its style? Fix it.

## Project (in the full packet)

You will style your personal site: one shared `styles.css` linked from the Home and About pages, site-wide rules for color, type and spacing, a reusable class or two, and a Flexbox navigation bar that looks the same on every page. A visitor sees a consistent, readable site and can move between pages from a tidy nav bar, and the restyled site is live at your GitHub Pages address. The full brief, the step-by-step build, and the finishing work in Git are in the Module 2 packet. [Get the packet →](https://code559.gumroad.com/l/module-02-css-foundations)

## Common misconception

> *"The rule lower down in the stylesheet always wins."*

What would you say? Hint: look again at line 3 in the cascade test, and at which rule came last.

## Summary

A `<link rel="stylesheet">` in the `<head>` fetches a CSS file by a relative path, and a wrong `href` silently removes every style. A rule is a selector followed by declarations of property and value. `color`, `background-color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `line-height`, `margin` and `padding` cover color, type and spacing, and some properties such as `color` are inherited. Element selectors style every element of a kind, while class selectors style only the elements you mark and can be reused anywhere; a selector with a space, such as `nav a`, matches elements inside other elements. When rules conflict, the more specific selector wins (id over class over element), and source order decides only a tie. Block boxes start on a new line and stack, while inline boxes sit in the line and ignore `width` and `height`. `display: flex` on a parent lines its children up in a row, and `gap`, `justify-content` and `align-items` control their spacing and alignment.

## Check your understanding

1. Your page has no styles at all, but your CSS file is full of rules. What are the first two things you check?
2. A `<p>` has `class="note"`. The stylesheet has `.note { color: green; }` and later `p { color: gray; }`. What color is the paragraph, and why?
3. **What happens if this changes?** A paragraph contains a link: `<p>Read <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a> first.</p>`. You add the rule `p a { width: 200px; }`. What changes on the page, and why?

## Before next module

- [ ] Your practice page links `styles.css` and shows your colors, fonts and spacing
- [ ] You broke the `href`, saw the unstyled page and the Console error, and fixed it
- [ ] You can explain why line 3 in the cascade test is purple
- [ ] Your nav uses `display: flex` with `gap`
- [ ] If you did this module's packet project in my-site, saved it with the routine: git status → git add . → git commit -m "…" → git push → check the live page. (Your practice folder is not saved to GitHub.)

## Go further

- MDN: *Handling conflicts* (cascade, specificity and inheritance)
- MDN: *Block and inline layout in normal flow* and *The box model*
- MDN: search "Basic concepts of flexbox" and the reference pages for `justify-content` and `align-items`
- MDN: search "CSS selectors" for type and class selectors
- freeCodeCamp: the CSS section of the Responsive Web Design curriculum

## What to keep

Keep your `practice-02` folder, including `cascade.html` and `cascade.css` if you typed the cascade test, and a one-line note in your own words of the rule for "which rule wins." Then answer for yourself: **which step would be hardest to repeat without this post, and why?**
