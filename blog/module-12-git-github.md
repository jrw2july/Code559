# Module 12 — Git, GitHub and Publishing

*Move from a memorized routine to a workflow you understand: diff, branches, merges, Issues, pull requests and releases.*

**Time:** about 2–3 hours (estimate)

<!-- about:start -->
<details>
<summary><strong>About this module</strong></summary>

**What this module covers**

You learn what your save routine actually does: staging, diffs, history, branches, merges, and Issues and pull requests connected with `Closes #1`. You also learn to tag a v1.0 release. It's what employers look for: a history of small, clear commits and merged pull requests shows you work the way a team does.

**Tips for the learner**

Some prompts ask you to explain code to yourself, out loud. Others ask you to write something down. Each habit does a different job.

**Recite to understand.** When a prompt says "out loud," explain the code in your own words, as if you were teaching it. Saying it aloud makes a deeper impression than reading silently. It helps you picture how the pieces of code fit together. And it shows you right away which line you cannot explain yet. That line is the one to review.

**Write it down to check yourself.** When a prompt says "write down," it is usually a prediction, a choice, or a guess about a bug. A written answer can't change after you see the result, so the comparison is fair and you learn from the difference. Writing also keeps your attention on the lesson and helps you pick out the main points.

**Keep one notebook for this course.** Use it for your predictions, key terms, steps, mistakes, and questions to come back to. Date each entry and write the module number, so you can find it later. Before you start a new module, read your last few entries and recite one or two of them out loud.

**The four badges**

Every core concept moves through the same four steps, called IEIA. Each step is marked with its badge.

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Introduce** (a lightbulb: a new idea) - You meet the concept: its name, and why it matters to you, in a sentence or two.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Explain** (a speech bubble: the idea in words) - How it works, one idea at a time, in plain words.

<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Illustrate** (an eye: see it) - A small example you can look at: a code snippet, a real screenshot or a diagram. Its caption, which starts with this badge, tells you what to notice.

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> - **Apply** (a keyboard: your turn) - A short task to do right now, before you read on. Often you type or predict something; sometimes you write it down, sketch it, or explain code to yourself out loud.

## Why this matters

In Module 1 you learned five steps to save your site, in the "Save your work" box: `git status` → `git add .` → `git commit -m "…"` → `git push` → check the live page. If you did the packet projects, you have used them in every module since. That routine works. But it treats Git like a black box. You type the words and hope.

This module opens the box. You will see where your changes sit at each step, check them before they become history, and try a new page on a branch without risking the working site. Then you will use the GitHub tools that teams use every day: an Issue that names the work, a pull request that proposes it, and a release that marks a finished version.

Employers read your GitHub profile. A history of small, clear commits, merged pull requests and a tagged v1.0 says "this person works the way we do." That is the goal of this module.

## Before you start

1. Your `my-site` folder from earlier modules is on GitHub, and the live page loads.
2. In VS Code, open a terminal. Type `git --version` and `gh auth status`. Both should answer without an error (you set them up in Module 0). Then type `git config init.defaultBranch`. It should print `main` (Module 0, step 8). If it prints nothing, run `git config --global init.defaultBranch main` now. Without it, `git init` names the first branch `master`, and `git switch main` in the Exercise fails with "fatal: invalid reference: main".
3. This module's Exercise uses a practice folder called `practice-12`, inside your `code559` folder. **Not** inside `my-site`.

> **Checkpoint.** `git --version` prints a version, `git config init.defaultBranch` prints `main`, `gh auth status` says you are logged in, and you know where your practice folder will go.

A note on the pictures. Every terminal image in this post comes from a real run of Git 2.43.0 in a throwaway project on Linux, drawn in a Windows Terminal frame. The commit IDs (like `b4cf5d1`) are real for that run; yours will be different, because a commit ID depends on the time and the author too. GitHub.com, VS Code and GitHub Desktop pictures are drawings, because nothing in this post was pushed to GitHub. The `git push` and `git pull` steps in Concepts 10 and 12 were checked against a local repository standing in for GitHub.

## Core concepts

### 1. Where does your work live in Git?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Git keeps your project in four places. Most confusion about Git comes from not knowing which place a change is in.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> The **working folder** is the files you see and edit. The **staging area** is a list of changes you have chosen for the next commit. **Commits** are saved snapshots, stored in the hidden `.git` folder on your computer. The **remote** is the copy on GitHub. `git add` moves a change from the folder to staging. `git commit` turns staging into a snapshot. `git push` sends your commits to GitHub. Nothing reaches GitHub until you push. `git pull` goes the other way: it downloads new commits from GitHub and brings your files up to date.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![Four boxes left to right: Working folder, Staging area, Commits, Remote (GitHub), joined by arrows labeled git add, git commit, git push, with a git pull arrow pointing back from Remote to Commits. Brackets underneath show what git diff and git diff --staged compare.](images/m12-mental-model.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Each arrow is one command. `git diff` compares the folder with staging; `git diff --staged` compares staging with the last commit.*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Predict: which box is a file in right after you save it in VS Code? (Answer: only the working folder.)

### 2. What is `git status` telling you?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `git status` is the question "where is everything right now?" Run it before and after every other Git command.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> In a brand-new project, Git lists your files as **untracked**: it sees them, but it is not keeping their history yet. `git status --short` gives the same facts in one line per file. The two characters at the start are two columns. The **left** column is the staging area; the **right** column is the working folder. `??` means untracked. `A` on the left means added to staging. `M` means modified: on the left it is staged, on the right it is not staged yet.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal in my-site running git init, then git status listing index.html and styles.css as untracked, then git status --short showing two lines beginning with question marks.](images/m12-init-status.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *The long form explains; the short form is faster once you can read it. `??` means "untracked." (real output, rendered; captured on Linux, with the folder path changed to the course folder)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> In your `my-site` folder, run `git status --short` now. An empty answer means nothing has changed since your last commit.

### 3. What do `git add` and `git commit` actually do?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `git add` chooses. `git commit` saves. They are separate so that you decide exactly what goes into each snapshot.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> You have used `git add .`, which stages everything. Naming one file, `git add index.html`, stages only that file. Then `git commit -m "message"` saves what is staged, and only that. This lets you follow the most useful habit in Git: **one change per commit**. A good message finishes the sentence "This commit will…": *Add home page structure*, *Add base styles*. Short, starts with a verb, says what changed. "stuff" and "fixes" tell your future self nothing.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal: git add index.html, git status --short showing A index.html and ?? styles.css, a commit, then git add styles.css and a second commit, then git status saying working tree clean.](images/m12-add-commit.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *After `git add index.html`, only that file has an `A`. Two files, two commits, two clear messages. "working tree clean" means the folder matches the last commit. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Look at your own `my-site` history with `git log --oneline` (Concept 5). Find one message that does not finish "This commit will…". You will write better ones from now on.

### 4. How do you check your work before you commit?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `git diff` shows exactly which lines changed. Reading it before every commit is how you catch a stray edit before it becomes history.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `git diff --stat` gives a summary: which files changed and how many lines. `git diff` shows the lines. A line starting with `+` was added; `-` was removed; the lines with no sign are context so you can find your place. Once you stage a file, plain `git diff` stops showing it, because it compares the folder with staging. To see what you are about to commit, use `git diff --staged`. If the output of `git diff` or `git log` is longer than your terminal window, Git shows it one screen at a time, with a `:` at the bottom. Press Space to see more, and press **q** to get back to the prompt.

In the story below, two different changes are waiting: a new tagline in `index.html` and a darker heading color in `styles.css`. That is two changes, so it should be two commits.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal: git diff --stat showing two files changed, then git diff showing a plus line adding a paragraph to index.html and a minus and plus pair changing a color in styles.css.](images/m12-diff.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *`--stat` first for the big picture, then the full diff. The color change shows as one `-` line and one `+` line. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0)*

![A terminal: git add index.html, git diff --staged showing only the tagline change, then two commits, one per file.](images/m12-diff-staged.png)
*`git diff --staged` shows only what the next commit will contain, so each commit holds one change. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Before your next commit on `my-site`, run `git diff --staged` and read every `+` and `-` line. If a line surprises you, do not commit yet.

### 5. How do you read history, and what is a branch?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `git log --oneline` lists your commits, newest first, one line each. A **branch** is a separate line of commits, so you can try something without touching `main`.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> In the terminal, Git also writes labels in brackets beside some commits. `HEAD` means "where you are now," so `(HEAD -> main)` says you are on the branch `main`, at that commit. `git switch -c add-about-page` creates a branch and moves you onto it. Commits you make there belong to that branch only. To prove it, list the files Git is tracking with `git ls-files`, switch back with `git switch main`, and list them again. The new page is gone from `main`; it is safe on its branch. `git branch` lists your branches and puts a `*` beside the one you are on. The git-scm.com manual describes `-c` as "Create a new branch named *<new-branch>* … before switching to the branch" (*git-switch*).

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal: git log --oneline with four commits, the newest marked (HEAD -> main), git switch -c add-about-page, a commit adding about.html, git ls-files listing three files, git switch main, git ls-files listing two files, git branch showing two branches with a star on main.](images/m12-branch.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *On the branch, `about.html` exists. Back on `main`, it does not. Same folder, different branch, different files. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Predict: if you open the folder in File Explorer while on `main`, will you see `about.html`? (No. Git removes it from the folder when you switch, and puts it back when you switch to the branch.)

### 6. How does a merge bring the branch back?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> When the branch is ready, you stand on `main` and run `git merge` with the branch name.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> If `main` has not changed since you made the branch, Git does not need a new commit. It simply moves `main` forward to the branch's last commit. The manual calls this a **fast-forward**: "only update the branch pointer to match the merged branch; do not create a merge commit" (*git-merge*). After the merge, the branch has done its job; `git branch -d` deletes the name. Your commits stay. Git refuses to delete a branch whose work is not merged yet. If you run `git branch -d add-about-page` before the merge, Git stops with "error: the branch 'add-about-page' is not fully merged". The next line suggests `git branch -D`. Do not use `-D` unless you want to throw that work away: it deletes the branch "irrespective of its merged status" (*git-branch*).

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal: git merge add-about-page printing Updating, Fast-forward and about.html 12 plus signs, then git ls-files now listing about.html on main, git log --oneline with five commits, the newest marked (HEAD -> main, add-about-page), and git branch -d deleting the branch.](images/m12-merge.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *"Fast-forward" means `main` just moved ahead; the log shows no extra merge commit. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Explain in one sentence why the log after the merge has exactly five lines, not six.

### 7. What are `switch`, `restore` and `checkout`?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> These three commands overlap, and you will see all three in tutorials.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `git switch` changes branches. `git restore` puts a file back. `git restore index.html` throws away the changes you have not staged: it copies the file back from the staging area. If you staged nothing, that is the same as the last commit. The manual says the contents are restored "from the index" (the staging area) unless you add `--staged` (*git-restore*). `git restore --staged styles.css` takes a file out of staging but keeps your edit in the folder. `git checkout` is the older command that does both jobs; its manual title is "Switch branches or restore working tree files" (*git-checkout*). `git checkout -b name` is the older way to write `git switch -c name`. You will meet it in older tutorials; this course uses `switch` and `restore` because each does one job. One more word you may hear is "check-in." That is not a Git command.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal: git status --short shows index.html modified, git restore index.html, status is empty; then styles.css staged with M in the left column, git restore --staged moves the M to the right column, git restore styles.css, and git status says working tree clean.](images/m12-restore.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Watch the `M` move from the left column (staged) to the right column (not staged) after `git restore --staged`. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Be careful: `git restore` on a file throws away your edits to it. There is no undo for edits you never committed. Run `git diff` on the file first.

### 8. How do you keep files out of Git?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Some files in your folder should never be committed: editor settings, system files, logs.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> A file named `.gitignore`, in the top of your project, lists patterns Git should ignore. Use this starter:

```
.vscode/
Thumbs.db
*.log
```

`.vscode/` (with the slash) matches a folder; the manual says a pattern ending in a slash "will only match directories." `Thumbs.db` is a file Windows can create to store picture thumbnails. `*.log` matches every file ending in `.log`, because "an asterisk `*` matches anything except a slash" (*gitignore*). One catch: "Files already tracked by Git are not affected" (*gitignore*). Add the `.gitignore` before you commit those files, not after. If you already committed one, the same page says to use `git rm --cached` "to remove the file from the index" (the staging area). For the editor folder, type `git rm -r --cached .vscode` (`-r` takes the whole folder), then commit. The files stay in your folder; Git stops tracking them.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal: git status --short lists .vscode/, Thumbs.db and debug.log as untracked; after .gitignore is created, git status --short lists only .gitignore; then it is committed and status is clean.](images/m12-gitignore.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *The proof: three untracked entries disappear the moment `.gitignore` exists. The files are still in the folder; Git just stops reporting them. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Run `git status --short` in `my-site`. If you see `.vscode/` or a `.log` file listed, that is your sign to add a `.gitignore`. If `git ls-files` lists a file inside `.vscode/`, it was committed before; use `git rm -r --cached .vscode` as above.

### 9. What goes in a README?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `README.md` is the first thing a visitor sees on your repository page. GitHub shows it below the file list.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> The `.md` means Markdown: `#` makes a heading, `##` a smaller one. This course uses four headings for every project: **What it does**, **Built with**, **What I learned**, **Live site**. Keep each to a sentence or two. "What I learned" is the one employers read.

<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> This is the README committed in the story (the commit appears in Concept 10):

```
# My Site

## What it does
A small personal website with a Home page and an About page.

## Built with
HTML and CSS.

## What I learned
How to keep a project's history with Git: one change per commit,
branches for new pages, and a .gitignore for files that do not belong.

## Live site
https://your-username.github.io/my-site/
```

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Draft the "What I learned" section for your own `my-site` in two sentences. You will use it in the Project.

### 10. How do you mark a finished version?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> A **tag** is a name stuck to one commit, such as `v1.0`. A GitHub **release** is a page built on a tag.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `git tag v1.0` puts the name on the commit you are on, so check that it is the right one first. If your last change was merged on GitHub, run `git switch main` and `git pull` (Concept 12), then check `git log --oneline`, and only then tag. `git tag` lists your tags, and `git log --oneline` shows the tag next to the commit as `tag: v1.0`. GitHub Docs explains the link: "Releases are based on Git tags, which mark a specific point in your repository's history" (*About releases*). A plain `git push` does not send tags. You send one with `git push origin v1.0`, and Git answers with a line like `* [new tag] v1.0 -> v1.0`. Or you can let GitHub create the tag when you draft the release on the website (*Managing releases in a repository*).

Your release, and the form on GitHub that makes it, may look a little different from the picture below. In the form, look for the **Choose a tag** menu, the **Release title** field and the **Publish release** button; those names come from GitHub Docs.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal: README.md committed, git tag v1.0, git tag printing v1.0, and git log --oneline showing (HEAD -> main, tag: v1.0) beside the newest commit.](images/m12-tag.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *`tag: v1.0` now sits on the README commit. That exact snapshot can always be found again by name. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0)*

![A GitHub release page for My Site v1.0 with a Latest badge, tag v1.0 on main, release notes and source code downloads.](images/m12-release.png)
*What a release looks like on GitHub: a title, notes and downloads, all pointing at the tagged commit.*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Run `git tag` in `my-site`. You probably have none yet. You will practice tagging with `v0.1` in the Exercise (step 8); if you do the packet project, you add `v1.0` there.

### 11. Can VS Code do all of this with buttons?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Yes. The Source Control view in VS Code runs the same Git commands behind its buttons.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> In a folder with no repository, the view shows **Initialize Repository** (the same as `git init`). When you have changes, each file has a **+** button, **Stage Changes**, which is `git add`. You type a message in the box and select **Commit**. To put a brand-new repository on GitHub you open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run **Publish to GitHub**. After that, **Sync Changes** sends and receives commits; VS Code's documentation says it "pulls remote changes before pushing your commits" (*Quickstart: use source control in VS Code*). The terminal is still the main tool in this course, because its messages teach you what happened. Use the buttons once you can say which command each one runs.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![Three Source Control panels: one with an Initialize Repository button; one with a commit message box, a Commit button, a staged index.html and an unstaged styles.css with a plus button; one with Publish to GitHub and Sync Changes buttons.](images/m12-vscode-source-control.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Each button is a Git command you already know.*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Open the Source Control view in `my-site` and match each file it lists to a line of `git status --short`.

### 12. How do Issues and pull requests work together?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> An **Issue** is a note on GitHub that names a piece of work. A **pull request** (PR) proposes the commits that do that work. GitHub Docs puts it plainly: "Pull requests are proposals to merge code changes into a project" (*Pull requests*).

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> The flow is: open an Issue (say, #1 "Add a Links page"); make a branch with `git switch -c add-links-page`; commit a new `links.html` on it; push the branch; open a pull request from the branch into `main`. The pull request gets the number #2, because Issues and pull requests in one repository share one list of numbers ("Pull requests are a type of issue," *REST API endpoints for pull requests*). In the PR description, write **`Closes #1`**. When the PR is merged, GitHub closes Issue #1 for you. The keywords that work are close, closes, closed, fix, fixes, fixed, resolve, resolves and resolved, and GitHub only reads them "when the pull request targets the repository's *default* branch" (*Linking a pull request to an issue*). For you, that is `main`.

Pushing a brand-new branch takes a little more than your usual `git push`:

```
git push -u origin add-links-page
```

`origin` is the name your GitHub copy got in Module 1 (the `--remote=origin` part of `gh repo create`). `-u` links your branch to a branch of the same name on GitHub; the manual says it adds an "upstream (tracking) reference" (*git-push*). After that, a plain `git push` on this branch works. If you forget `-u`, a plain `git push` stops with "The current branch add-links-page has no upstream branch" and prints the command to use (`--set-upstream` is the long form of `-u`).

Working alone, you can still review your own work. In the PR, open **Files changed**, hover a line number, and click the blue comment icon. Type a note, then choose **Comment** for one note or **Start a review** for several (*Commenting on a pull request*). If you start a review, finish it: click **Submit review** (some screens call this first button **Review changes**), write a short summary, and click **Submit review** again. Until then, your notes are "pending and only visible to you" (*Reviewing proposed changes in a pull request*). Reading your own diff on GitHub, slowly, catches mistakes you skipped past in the terminal.

When you merge the pull request on GitHub, the merge exists only on GitHub, not on your computer yet. To bring it home, run:

```
git switch main
git pull
git log --oneline
```

`git switch main` may say your branch is "up to date"; it has not asked GitHub yet, so pull anyway. `git pull` downloads the new commits and moves your `main` forward; look for `Fast-forward`. `git log --oneline` should now show GitHub's merge commit ("Merge pull request #2 …") at the top, marked `(HEAD -> main, origin/main)`; Git 2.48 and later may also add `origin/HEAD` there. Only now tag the version (Concept 10). A tag made before `git pull` lands on an older commit, without the new page.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A GitHub page showing Issue #1 Add a Links page beside Pull request #2 Add Links page, which wants to merge add-links-page into main and whose description ends with Closes #1, and a note that merging closes the issue.](images/m12-issue-pr.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *`Closes #1` in the description links the two. Merge into `main`, and the Issue closes.*

![A GitHub Files changed view of links.html with a blue plus icon beside line 11 and a comment box with Start a review and Comment buttons.](images/m12-line-comment.png)
*A line comment on your own pull request: a note pinned to the exact line it is about.*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Write, on paper, the title of an Issue for the next change you want on `my-site`. Keep it to a few words that start with a verb.

### 13. What is GitHub Desktop?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> GitHub Desktop is "a free, open source application that helps you to work with files hosted on GitHub or other Git hosting services" (*About GitHub Desktop*). It runs on Windows and macOS.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> It shows the same ideas you now know: a Changes list (status and diff), a History list (log), a commit box, and buttons to talk to GitHub. In this course it is **awareness only**. You do not need to install it. If a future job uses it, you will recognize every part.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A GitHub Desktop window with Current repository my-site, Current branch main, a Changes tab listing index.html, a diff with one added line, and a commit button.](images/m12-github-desktop.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Different screen, same model: changes, staging, commit, history.*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Name the terminal command that matches the History tab. (`git log`.)

### 14. What does "dubious ownership" mean?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> One day Git may refuse to work in a folder and print `fatal: detected dubious ownership in repository`.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Git checks that the folder belongs to the user account running Git. If it does not, Git stops, so that a repository someone else controls cannot run settings on your account. On Windows this tends to happen with folders on an external or network drive, or folders copied from another account. Your work is fine. Git prints the fix itself: one `git config --global --add safe.directory …` command with your folder's path. Copy it exactly as Git prints it, run it, and run `git status` again. On Windows, Git for Windows also prints which account owns the folder and which account you are using, so your message has a few more lines than the picture; the last line is still the fix.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal: git status fails with fatal: detected dubious ownership and prints a git config --global --add safe.directory command; that command is run, and git status then works.](images/m12-dubious.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Git names the exact command to run. After it, `git status` works. The message was caused by giving a copy of the project to a different user account. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux, with the folder path changed to the course folder)*

Which folders trigger this message depends on your drives and accounts, so you may never see it. If you do, your folder path will be in the message instead of the one in the picture.

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> If you ever see this message, read the last line first. That is the fix.

## Exercise

*Your hands, about 45 minutes (estimate).* Type every command. Do not paste. This is a throwaway folder: you will not push it.

1. **Make the practice folder.** In File Explorer, create `practice-12` inside your `code559` folder (beside `my-site`, not inside it). Open it in VS Code with **File → Open Folder…**, then **Terminal → New Terminal**. Check that the prompt ends in `practice-12>`.
2. **Start a repository.** Type `git init`. Create a file `notes.txt` with one line, `Favorite color: blue`. Press **Enter** at the end of the line, so the cursor sits on an empty line 2. Save it. Then:

   ```
   git status --short
   git add notes.txt
   git commit -m "Add notes"
   ```

   *Predict* before you press Enter on the first line: what two characters will start the line? (`??`.)
3. **Make a branch.** `git switch -c add-hobby`. Add a second line to `notes.txt`, for example `Hobby: drawing`, and press **Enter** at the end of it too. Save. Then check before you commit:

   ```
   git diff
   git add notes.txt
   git diff --staged
   git commit -m "Add hobby line"
   ```

   Both diffs should show one `+` line. If you also see a `-` line with your color, or the note `\ No newline at end of file`, a line in the file did not end with Enter. Git counts the line ending as part of the line, so that line shows as changed. It is not an error: carry on, and end each line with Enter from now on.
4. **Prove the branch is separate.** `git switch main`. Look at `notes.txt` in VS Code (or type `cat notes.txt`). The hobby line is gone.
5. **Merge it.** Still on `main`: `git merge add-hobby`. Look for the word `Fast-forward`. Then `git branch -d add-hobby` and `git log --oneline`. You should see two commits.
6. **Break it on purpose: a merge conflict.** You will change the same line two different ways on two branches.

   ```
   git switch -c change-color
   ```

   Change `blue` to `green` in `notes.txt`, save, then `git add notes.txt` and `git commit -m "Change color to green"`. Now `git switch main`, change `blue` to `orange`, save, `git add notes.txt`, `git commit -m "Change color to orange"`. Finally:

   ```
   git merge change-color
   ```

   Read the whole message.

   ![A terminal: git merge change-color prints CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in notes.txt; git status --short shows UU notes.txt; the file contains HEAD and change-color sections separated by equals signs, with the hobby line untouched below.](images/m12-conflict.png)
   *Git merged what it could (the hobby line) and stopped at the line both branches changed. `UU` means "both changed it." Between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` is your side (`main`); below it, the branch. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0. On Windows, `cat` in PowerShell shows the same file lines.)*

7. **Fix it.** Open `notes.txt` in VS Code. Delete the three marker lines (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and the color you do not want, so one `Favorite color` line is left. VS Code can do this for you with the links it shows above the conflict: **Accept Current Change** keeps your side on `main` (the line `Favorite color: orange`) and **Accept Incoming Change** keeps the branch's side (the line `Favorite color: green`) (*Resolve merge conflicts in VS Code*). Save. Then:

   ```
   git add notes.txt
   git commit -m "Merge change-color, keep green"
   git log --oneline --graph
   git branch -d change-color
   ```

   ![A terminal: the merge commit is made, and git log --oneline --graph draws two lines splitting after Add hobby line and joining again at the merge commit, then the branch is deleted.](images/m12-conflict-fixed.png)
   *This time the log shows a real merge commit with two parents: the graph splits and joins. Compare it with the straight line after the fast-forward in step 5. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0)*

8. **Tag it.** `git tag v0.1`, then `git log --oneline -1`. The newest commit should show `tag: v0.1`.
9. **Modify.** Make one more branch of your own, change one line, save, and commit it on the branch (`git add notes.txt`, then `git commit -m "…"`). Then `git switch main` and merge your branch. Before you merge, think this through: will it be a fast-forward, and why? If you also committed something on `main`, the merge makes a merge commit, and Git opens an editor in the terminal for its message. Git for Windows uses Vim unless you chose another editor. To keep Git's message, press **Esc**, type `:wq` and press **Enter**.

## Project (in the full packet)

You put your real `my-site` through the full team workflow, start to finish. You add a `.gitignore` and a `README.md` with the four headings, open a GitHub Issue for one real improvement, do the work on a branch, push the branch, open a pull request whose description says `Closes #n`, leave line comments on your own diff, merge it, and watch the Issue close by itself. Then you bring the merge to your computer with `git switch main` and `git pull`, check `git log --oneline`, tag the result `v1.0`, push the tag, and publish it as your site's first GitHub release. A visitor to your repository sees a clear README, a tidy history of small commits, a closed Issue linked to a merged pull request, and a v1.0 release. The full brief, the step-by-step build, and the finishing work in Git are in the Module 12 packet. [Get the packet →](PACKET_LINK_MODULE_12)

## Common misconception

> *"When I commit, my work is saved on GitHub."*

What would you say? Hint: look at the mental-model picture in Concept 1. Which arrow leads from the Commits box to GitHub?

## Summary

Git keeps your work in four places, and `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` move it from the working folder to staging, to commits, to GitHub. `git status --short` tells you where each file is, with the left column for staging and the right column for the folder. One change per commit, with a message that finishes "This commit will…", makes your history readable. `git diff`, `git diff --staged` and `git diff --stat` let you check every line before it becomes history, and `git log --oneline` reads that history back. A branch made with `git switch -c` keeps new work separate until `git merge` brings it in, often as a fast-forward, and `git branch -d` tidies up. `git switch` changes branches and `git restore` puts files back; `git checkout` is the older command that does both. A `.gitignore` keeps editor, system and log files out, and `git status` proves it. A README with four headings tells visitors what the project is. A tag names a version, and a GitHub release is built on it. VS Code's Source Control view and GitHub Desktop do the same jobs with buttons. Issues name the work, pull requests propose it, `Closes #n` links them, and line comments let you review yourself. A new branch goes to GitHub with `git push -u origin` and the branch name, and after a pull request is merged there, `git pull` on `main` brings the merge to your computer before you tag. "Dubious ownership" is a safety check, and Git prints its own fix.

## Check your understanding

1. `git status --short` shows these two lines. Which file is ready to commit, and how can you tell?

   ```
   M  styles.css
    M index.html
   ```

2. In the Exercise, why did step 5 say `Fast-forward` while step 6 stopped with a conflict?
3. **What would you test** to prove that your `.gitignore` is working?

## Before next module

This module is the full workflow, so instead of the short routine, check off the whole thing:

- [ ] I can draw the four places (folder, staging, commits, remote) and name the command between each
- [ ] I run `git status` (or `--short`) before and after other Git commands, and can read the two columns
- [ ] I run `git diff --stat`, `git diff` and `git diff --staged` before every commit
- [ ] Each commit holds one change, with a message that finishes "This commit will…"
- [ ] I can make a branch with `git switch -c`, prove it is separate, merge it, and delete it
- [ ] I can fix a merge conflict by removing the markers, then `git add` and `git commit`
- [ ] I know to run `git pull` on `main` after a pull request is merged, and to tag only after that
- [ ] I can still do the short routine: `git status` → `git add .` → `git commit -m "…"` → `git push` → check the live page

If you did this module's packet project in `my-site`:

- [ ] `my-site` has a `.gitignore` (`.vscode/`, `Thumbs.db`, `*.log`) and a `README.md` with the four headings
- [ ] I have opened an Issue, a pull request with `Closes #n`, and left a line comment on my own PR
- [ ] After the pull request was merged, I ran `git pull` on `main` before tagging
- [ ] `my-site` has a `v1.0` tag and a GitHub release

## Go further

- git-scm.com manual pages: *git-switch*, *git-merge* (the "Fast-forward merge" and "How conflicts are presented" sections), *gitignore*, *git-restore*, *git-checkout*
- GitHub Docs: *Pull requests*, *Linking a pull request to an issue*, *Commenting on a pull request*, *About issues*, *About releases*, *About GitHub Desktop*
- VS Code Docs: *Quickstart: use source control in VS Code* and *Source control in VS Code*
- GitHub Skills, free practice exercises that run inside a repository of your own:
  - *Communicate using Markdown* (`skills/communicate-using-markdown`) for your README
  - *Review pull requests* (`skills/review-pull-requests`)
  - *Resolve Merge Conflicts* (`skills/resolve-merge-conflicts`)
  - *Create a release based workflow* (`skills/release-based-workflow`)

## What to keep

Keep your `practice-12` folder until you finish the Project; its `git log --oneline --graph` is a picture of both kinds of merge. Keep your Issue title and your "What I learned" draft. Then answer for yourself: **which step would be hardest to repeat without this post, and why?**
