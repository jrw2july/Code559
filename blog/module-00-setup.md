# Module 0 — Setup

*Install every tool once, so no later module stops for an install.*

**In this module you will learn:**

- What each tool in a front-end developer's kit does, and why you need it
- How to show file extensions in File Explorer
- How to install VS Code, and how you will see your pages in Edge or Chrome (the Live Preview extension is optional)
- How to turn off VS Code's built-in AI features, and why this course asks you to
- How to install Git and set your name, email and default branch
- How to install the GitHub CLI and sign in to GitHub from the terminal
- How to install Node.js so you can run JavaScript outside the browser
- How to open a terminal in the right folder, and why you restart VS Code after each install

## Why this matters

Every developer works inside a small set of tools. You write code in an editor, you look at the result in a browser, you save your history with Git, and you publish with GitHub. If one of those is missing in the middle of a lesson, you stop learning and start troubleshooting. This module puts everything in place first.

You will also make one decision that shapes the rest of the course: you will turn off the AI assistant in your editor. That is not because AI tools are bad. It is because this course asks you to explain every line you commit, and the simplest way to explain a line truthfully is to have written it yourself.

By the end you will have four tools installed and checked, a browser to see your pages, and a folder ready for the site you build in Module 1.

![Five boxes in a row: VS Code, Edge or Chrome, Git, GitHub CLI, Node.js, with what each one does.](images/m00-toolkit.png)
*The five tools you use from now on and the job each one does. Edge is already on Windows 11; you install the other four in this module.*

## Before you start

1. You need a Windows 11 computer with an internet connection and permission to install software. This course is written for Windows only.
2. Create a free GitHub account at github.com if you do not have one. Pick a username you would be happy to show an employer; it appears in your website address later.
3. Decide where your course work will live. Choose a folder with a **short name and no spaces**, for example a folder called `code559` inside Documents.

> **Checkpoint.** You can sign in to github.com, and you know the folder where your course work will live.

## Core concepts

### 1. What is each tool for?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> A front-end developer builds the part of a website that people see and use. To do that you need a place to write code, a way to see it, a way to keep its history, and a place to publish it.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> **VS Code** is the editor where you type HTML, CSS and JavaScript. **Edge or Chrome** is the browser where you see your page; after each save you press F5 to reload it. **Git** keeps a history of your project as a series of saved snapshots, called commits. **GitHub** is a website that stores a copy of that history online and can publish your site. The **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) lets you do GitHub tasks from the terminal. **Node.js** runs JavaScript outside the browser; you will use it in the JavaScript modules.

<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Look at the toolkit picture above. Every box is something you will use in almost every module.

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Before you install anything, say out loud which tool you would use to (a) see your page, (b) save a snapshot, (c) publish. Check your answers against the paragraph above.

### 2. Why show file extensions?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> A file extension is the part of a name after the last dot: `.html`, `.css`, `.js`. Windows hides it by default.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> When extensions are hidden, a file you meant to name `index.html` can quietly become `index.html.txt`, and the browser treats it as plain text. Showing extensions stops that mistake before it happens.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A File Explorer window listing a folder, a text file and index.html with the full extension visible.](images/m00-explorer-extensions.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *With extensions shown, you can see that the file really ends in `.html`.*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Open File Explorer. Select **View → Show → File name extensions** so it has a check mark.

### 3. How will you see your pages?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> VS Code is free and made by Microsoft. You write a page in VS Code and look at it in a browser. This course uses Edge or Chrome. Edge is already on Windows 11, so you need nothing extra.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> From Module 1 on, you open each page straight in the browser: double-click the file in File Explorer, or drag it onto a browser window. (Double-clicking it in VS Code opens the code, not the page.) After each save, press **F5** to reload. Later modules also use **F12**, which opens the browser's DevTools. This works the same way on every page in the course.

**Optional: Live Preview.** Live Preview is a Microsoft extension for VS Code that, in its own words, "Hosts a local server in your workspace for you to preview your webpages on" (VS Code Marketplace, *Live Preview*). It shows your page inside VS Code and updates it when you save. You do not need it for this course, and the Marketplace page says it "is still under development." If you install it, know one thing: VS Code opens a new folder in **Restricted Mode** (VS Code Docs, *Workspace Trust*), and Live Preview stays off in Restricted Mode. To turn it on, trust the folder: in the Restricted Mode banner at the top, click **Manage**, then click **Trust**. Only trust folders you made yourself, like your course folders.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![VS Code's Extensions view showing Live Preview by Microsoft with an Install button.](images/m00-vscode-live-preview.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *If you choose to install Live Preview, search the Extensions view for "Live Preview" and check that the publisher is Microsoft before you install.*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> You will install VS Code in the Exercise. Live Preview is step 5, and you may skip it.

### 4. Why turn off AI features?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Current VS Code includes GitHub Copilot features. VS Code's documentation says you can "disable the built-in AI features in VS Code with the `chat.disableAIFeatures`" setting (VS Code Docs, *Set up GitHub Copilot in VS Code*).

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> This course has one honesty rule: **if a tool wrote a line, you mark it and explain it.** While you are learning, it is much simpler to write every line yourself. You can turn AI features back on later, after you can read and explain code without help.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![VS Code Settings with chat.disableAIFeatures searched and checked.](images/m00-vscode-ai-off.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Type the setting name into the Settings search box and tick it.*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> You will do this in step 4 of the Exercise.

### 5. What does Git need to know about you?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Every commit records who made it. Git needs a name and an email for that.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> You set three things once, with `git config --global`: your name, your email, and the name of the first branch in new projects. Git still names the first branch `master` unless you tell it otherwise; GitHub uses `main`. Setting `init.defaultBranch` to `main` keeps the two in agreement.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal showing git --version, three git config commands with no output, then git config --global --list printing the three settings.](images/m00-git-config.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *The three `config` commands print nothing when they work. `--list` proves they were saved. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0. On Windows the version line ends in `.windows.1` or similar, and your version will be newer.)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Predict: what will `git config --global --list` show if you skip the email line? (Answer: only two lines.)

### 6. Why sign in to GitHub from the terminal?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> The GitHub CLI can create a repository on GitHub and push your files to it with one command. It needs permission to act as you.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> `gh auth login` asks a few questions, then opens your browser so you can approve the sign-in. You answer **GitHub.com**, then **HTTPS**, then **Yes** to "Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials?", then choose **Login with a web browser**. Next, the terminal shows a one-time code on a line that starts `! First copy your one-time code:`. Copy the code or write it down. The terminal then says **Press Enter to open** a github.com address **in your browser**. Press Enter, and your browser opens a GitHub page. Paste or type the code there and approve the sign-in. The terminal then says **Authentication complete** and **Logged in as** your username. (These messages are checked against the GitHub CLI's source code in the cli/cli repository on GitHub.)

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal running gh auth login, showing the first three prompts answered GitHub.com and HTTPS, ending at the Authenticate Git question.](images/m00-gh-auth-prompts.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *The first three prompts as GitHub CLI 2.89.0 prints them. Use the arrow keys to move and Enter to choose. The "How would you like to authenticate" question and the one-time-code steps come next; they are described above, not shown here. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> After you sign in, `gh auth status` should say you are logged in to github.com. That is your proof.

### 7. Why install Node.js now?

<img src="images/brand/marker-introduce.svg" alt="Introduce" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> Node.js runs JavaScript on your computer instead of inside a web page.

<img src="images/brand/marker-explain.svg" alt="Explain" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> In Modules 5 to 8 you will practice the JavaScript language before you touch a web page. Node lets you run a script from the terminal and see the result. Installing it now means those modules never stop for setup. Node's download page lists **v24.21.0** as the current LTS (Long-Term Support) version on the day this post was written; "LTS" is the version to choose.

<div role="separator" style="display:flex;align-items:flex-end;margin:1.5em 0;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:1;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-window.svg" alt="" style="width:70px;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-wall.svg" alt="" style="flex:3;min-width:0;height:34px;"><img src="images/brand/divider-door.svg" alt="" style="width:46px;height:34px;"></div>

![A terminal showing node --version printing v22.22.0 and npm --version printing 10.9.4.](images/m00-node-version.png)
<img src="images/brand/marker-illustrate.svg" alt="Illustrate" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> *Two version numbers mean both Node and npm (its package manager) are installed. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Node 22. Your numbers will be newer, for example v24.x.)*

<img src="images/brand/marker-apply.svg" alt="Apply" width="24" height="24" style="vertical-align:-0.35em;"> After installing, run `node --version`. Any `v` followed by numbers is a pass.

## Exercise

*Your hands, about 60 minutes (estimate).* Type every command. Do not paste. Typing is how your fingers learn the commands.

1. **Show file extensions.** In File Explorer: **View → Show → File name extensions**.
2. **Make your course folder.** Create the folder you chose (for example `Documents\code559`). Inside it, create a folder called `my-site`.
3. **Install VS Code.** Download it from code.visualstudio.com and run the installer. On the "Select Additional Tasks" screen, tick **Add "Open with Code" action to Windows Explorer file context menu** and **Add to PATH**. The wording on your screen may be a little different; look for the two options that add "Open with Code" to the right-click menu and add VS Code to PATH.
4. **Turn off AI features.** In VS Code: **File → Preferences → Settings**. Type `chat.disableAIFeatures` in the search box and tick it.
5. **Optional: install Live Preview.** You can skip this step: Edge or Chrome and F5 are all this course needs (Concept 3). To install it, click the Extensions icon in the left bar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X). Search **Live Preview**. Check the publisher says **Microsoft**. Click **Install**. It stays off until you trust your folder in step 6.
6. **Open a terminal.** In VS Code: **File → Open Folder…**, choose `my-site`, then **Terminal → New Terminal**. The prompt should end in `my-site>`. If VS Code shows a Restricted Mode banner or asks whether you trust this folder, trust it: it is your own folder (Concept 3). VS Code may ask again when you open each new practice folder in later modules; trust those too, for the same reason.

   ![VS Code with the my-site folder open and a terminal at the bottom whose prompt ends in my-site>.](images/m00-vscode-terminal.png)
   *The prompt shows which folder the terminal is in. Always check it before you type a Git command.*

7. **Install Git.** In the terminal type:

   ```
   winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
   ```

   (This is the command on git-scm.com's *Install for Windows* page.) When it finishes, **restart VS Code**: close it completely with **File → Exit**, then open VS Code again. It normally reopens your `my-site` folder; if not, use **File → Open Folder…**. Then choose **Terminal → New Terminal** and type `git --version`. A new terminal inside the same VS Code window is not enough, because it still uses the settings VS Code had before the install. VS Code's own docs say: "If the command isn't found, restart VS Code after installing Git" (VS Code Docs, *Quickstart: use source control in VS Code*). Still "not recognized"? Restart the computer, then try again.
8. **Configure Git.** Use your real name and the email on your GitHub account:

   ```
   git config --global init.defaultBranch main
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
   git config --global --list
   ```

9. **Install the GitHub CLI.**

   ```
   winget install --id GitHub.cli --source winget
   ```

   (From the GitHub CLI manual's Windows install page.) Restart VS Code as in step 7 (**File → Exit**, open VS Code again, **Terminal → New Terminal**). Type `gh --version`, then `gh auth login` and answer as in Core Concept 6. Finish with `gh auth status`.
10. **Install Node.js (LTS).**

    ```
    winget install --id OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS -e --source winget
    ```

    Restart VS Code as in step 7 (**File → Exit**, open VS Code again, **Terminal → New Terminal**). Type `node --version` and `npm --version`. The package id `OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` is listed in Microsoft's official winget catalog (the microsoft/winget-pkgs repository on GitHub). If winget says "No package found," download the LTS installer from nodejs.org instead.
11. **Break it on purpose.** In the same terminal, type `git stauts` (letters swapped). Read the message. Git says the command does not exist and suggests the closest real one.

    ![A terminal showing git stauts and Git's reply that stauts is not a git command, with status as the most similar command.](images/m00-git-typo.png)
    *Git names the real command it thinks you meant. Learning to read messages like this is a skill you will use every day. (real output, rendered; captured on Linux with Git 2.43.0)*

    Now try `git --verison`. This time Git only prints "unknown option" and its usage summary, with no suggestion. Same kind of typo, different help: always read the whole message.

## Project (in the full packet)

There is no build project in Module 0. The full packet adds a one-page **setup log** you fill in (each tool, its version number, and the command that proved it), plus a troubleshooting section for the five most common install problems. The full packet is the Module 0 packet. [Get the packet →](PACKET_LINK_MODULE_0)

## Common misconception

> *"Git and GitHub are the same thing."*

What would you say? Hint: one of them works with no internet connection at all.

## Summary

A front-end developer writes code in VS Code, sees it in Edge or Chrome (open the file, press F5 after each save; Live Preview is an optional extra), records its history with Git, and publishes it through GitHub, using the GitHub CLI from the terminal; Node.js runs JavaScript outside the browser. Showing file extensions stops files from getting a hidden `.txt` ending. AI features are off so that every line you commit is a line you wrote and can explain. Git needs your name, your email and a default branch name of `main`. After every install, close VS Code completely and reopen it, then a new terminal and a version command prove the tool is ready.

## Check your understanding

1. You install Git, open a new terminal in the same VS Code window, run `git --version` and get "not recognized." What is the most likely fix?
2. Why does this course set `init.defaultBranch` to `main`?
3. **What would you test** to prove the GitHub CLI is signed in?

## Before next module

- [ ] File extensions are visible in File Explorer
- [ ] `git --version`, `gh --version` and `node --version` all print a version
- [ ] `gh auth status` says you are logged in
- [ ] AI features are off in VS Code
- [ ] You have a `my-site` folder and can open a terminal in it
- [ ] You know how to see a page: open it in Edge or Chrome and press F5 after each save (Live Preview is optional; if you installed it, your folder is trusted)

## What to keep

Keep a note of the four version numbers you saw (Git, GitHub CLI, Node, npm) and the folder path of `my-site`. Then answer for yourself: **which step would be hardest to repeat without this post, and why?**
